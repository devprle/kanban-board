# Kanban Board Application

This project represents a Kanban board application where users can manage tasks across three columns. Users can move task cards between columns using drag and drop, create new cards, delete them, and filter them through a search field. The application also persists the current state even after a page refresh.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
 git clone https://github.com/devprle/kanban-board
```   
2.  Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd kanban-board 
```
3.  Install dependencies:
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

The application is straightforward to use. After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at localhost.
